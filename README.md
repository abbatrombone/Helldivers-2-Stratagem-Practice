# Helldivers-2-Stratagem-Practice

This is a practice tool for inputting stratagems in Helldivers 2. You can set up your own keybinds in the settings menu. It can only be binded to a single key. You can also change the text size and color, as well as the textbox size and color. This is done in the settings drop down as well. If there are any issues, please look at your log file in ./local for linux, and appdata/roaming for winodws. Put the error in there and then make an issue on github. Enjoy!

As an interesting addition to this project i had an AI code a copy of the program and compare our programs to see who did better. the GPT/src is its code with the prompts and code marked. Any commented out code was done by me to see if the program had an extra bugs. The Expirement `Results.txt` file is there to talk about the general overview of how it went.
