# Helldivers-2-Stratagem-Practice

This is a practice tool for inputting stratagems in Helldivers 2. You can set up your own keybinds in the settings menu. It can only be binded to a single key. You can also change the text size and color, as well as the textbox size and color. This is done in the settings drop down as well. If there are any issues, please look at your log file in ./local for linux, and appdata/roaming for winodws. Put the error in there and then make an issue on github. Enjoy!
