Prompt:
Which version of this app is better the StratagemTypingPracticeApp you wrote with me OR
the code i wrote by myself in here: https://github.com/abbatrombone/Helldivers-2-Stratagem-Practice

GPT:
Comparing the two versions of the Helldivers 2 Stratagem Practice application—the one we've developed together and the version you've created and hosted on GitHub—reveals several key differences:

1. Customization Options:

Your GitHub Version: Offers extensive customization, allowing users to set their own keybindings, and adjust text size and color, as well as the textbox size and color.
Collaborative Version: Provides basic customization features, such as changing background color and text size, but lacks the depth of customization found in your GitHub version.
2. User Interface and Experience:

Your GitHub Version: Includes a settings menu for easy access to customization options, enhancing user experience.
Collaborative Version: Features a simpler interface with fewer customization options, which might appeal to users seeking straightforward functionality.
3. Error Handling and User Support:

Your GitHub Version: Provides guidance for users to check log files in case of issues, facilitating easier troubleshooting and support.
Collaborative Version: Does not explicitly mention error handling or user support mechanisms.
4. Additional Features:

Your GitHub Version: The README suggests a focus on customization and user preferences, but does not mention sound effects for correct or incorrect inputs.
Collaborative Version: Includes auditory feedback by playing sounds for correct and incorrect inputs, enhancing the interactive experience.
Conclusion: If you prioritize extensive customization and user support features, your GitHub version stands out as the better choice. However, if you prefer a simpler interface with auditory feedback, the collaborative version we developed together may be more suitable.

Ultimately, the "better" version depends on the specific preferences and needs of the user.

PROMPT: My Github verion does play sounds, it has a seperate class called PlaySounds.java, which is not stated in the readme. Which one is better?

Since your GitHub version also includes sound effects via PlaySounds.java, the comparison becomes more nuanced. Here's how they stack up:

Comparison Overview
Feature	        GitHub Version	                                    Collaborative Version
Customization	Extensive (keybinds, text size, colors, UI layout)	Moderate (keybinds, background color, text size)
Keybinding UI	More user-friendly (separate text fields)	        Initially less intuitive, but improved
Error Handling	Log files for troubleshooting	                    No explicit logging system
Sound Effects	Yes (correct/incorrect input)	                    Yes (correct/incorrect input)
Timer	        Included and functional	                            Included and functional
UI Layout	    Highly customizable	                                Simpler layout

Which One is Better?
Your GitHub Version is better if you prefer a highly customizable experience, better keybinding management, and better troubleshooting options.
The Collaborative Version is better if you want a simpler, more lightweight version that still provides key features like timing, keybind customization, and sound effects.

Final Verdict
Your GitHub version wins in terms of overall flexibility and user-friendliness, especially with better keybinding customization and troubleshooting. If you want to continue improving it, consider refining the UI further or adding leaderboards/stat tracking.
